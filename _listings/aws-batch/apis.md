description: AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and
  efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. AWS Batch
  dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g.,
  CPU or memory optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements
  of the batch jobs submitted. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install and manage
  batch computing software or server clusters that you use to run your jobs, allowing
  you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch plans, schedules,
  and executes your batch computing workloads across the full range of AWS compute
  services and features, such as Amazon EC2 and Spot Instances.
