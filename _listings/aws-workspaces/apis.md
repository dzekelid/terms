description: Amazon WorkSpaces is a fully managed, secure desktop computing service
  which runs on the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkSpaces allows you to easily provision cloud-based
  virtual desktops and provide your users access to the documents, applications, and
  resources they need from any supported device, including Windows and Mac computers,
  Chromebooks, iPads, Fire tablets, Android tablets, and Chrome and Firefox web browsers.
  With just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can deploy high-quality
  cloud desktops for any number of users. With Amazon WorkSpaces, you pay either monthly
  or hourly just for the Amazon WorkSpaces you launch, which helps you save money
  when compared to traditional desktops and on-premises Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
  (VDI) solutions.
